  description: "Jabuticaba tree a unique tree with equality different fruits that alegelly only grows in brazil can teach a lot about doing business",
  date: new Date(2022, 10, 2), 
}

In Brazilian business jargon, the term "Jabuticaba" is used to describe a political or legal situation that is considered absurd, overly complex, or needlessly convoluted. 
The term is rooted in the popular belief that Jabuticaba trees, a fruit-bearing plant native to Brazil, can only grow in the country's unique environment. 
Thus, the term "Jabuticaba" has come to symbolize the idea that certain situations or systems in Brazil are so uniquely Brazilian that they cannot be fully understood or appreciated outside of the country's context. 
<br/>

Jabuticaba Trees are indeed truly unique and serves as an perfect example to ackwarnedss faced when doing businesses abroad. 
Any foreign facing a Jabuticaba tree for the first time will have a hard time trying to understand it; The fruits are pitch black, grow directly from main branches and look poisonous. 
You can't bite the fruit all at once, otherwise you'll have to deal with the bitter taste of fruit rind. 
You can't peal it, and you can't just eat it all at once; You give a gentle bite, eat just the pulp and spit out the rest. And remember: Never chew it.
But trust me, Jabuticabas are unique and delicious. 
<br/>

Jabuticaba tree and its fruit are a perfect example of the uniqueness and complexity that is so often associated with Brazil. Like the political and legal situations that are described as 'Jabuticaba' in Brazilian business jargon, the Jabuticaba tree can only thrive in Brazil's distinct environment, and its fruit is often misunderstood by those who are unfamiliar with it. 

<br/>

<br/>
By embracing the complexity and uniqueness of the Jabuticaba, we can better understand and appreciate the complexity and uniqueness of the Brazilian culture and business landscape.

------------------

**Jabuticaba** In Brazilian politics, and less commonly in everyday speech, *Jabuticaba* is a slang that describes a political or legal setting that is considered absurd, unusual, or needlessly complex, among others, that could only exist in a country like Brazil. It is a reference to the popular wisdom that jabuticaba trees can only grow in Brazil. 

 [Series B last December](/2020/next-for-vercel), I'm happy to announce we've raised a [**$102M Series C**](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/vercel-raises-102m-series-c-for-its-next-js-based-front-end-development-platform) from existing and new investors.

Our vision of the Web is a global realtime medium for both creators and consumers,
where all friction and latency are eliminated.

We'll use this investment to:
1. [**Build the SDK for Web**](#next-momentum)
2. [**Lower the barrier of entry**](#realtime)
3. [**Focus on the end-user**](#real)

## 1. Hire and develop the best

Unlike other software development platforms, the Web never came with an SDK or Standard Development Kit.

Next.js builds on this formidable foundation to give developers and companies
a meaningful starting point to build great pages, [open sourcing the lessons](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11#conformance) learned from the giants of the Web.


## id="realtime">2. Embrace conflict

deploy and scale frontend projects. But significant challenges remain to
frictionless collaboration:

- Setting up and maintaining your developer environment
- Integrating it into Git for continuous integration
- Manually pushing and waiting to share progress with your team


Perhaps the most incredible aspect of the Web is that it's not a read-only medium.
Each Web browser is simultaneously the [consumption and creation mechanism](https://twitter.com/sulco/status/1177559150563344384).

With [Next.js Live](https://nextjs.org/live), we want to build a Web that 
everyone can contribute to. Whether it's to pitch in an idea or an edit,
by an experienced developer or a new designer, from a local editor or the
browser itself.


## id="real">3. Focus on the end-user


A particularly interesting challenge of building a platform and tooling 
company is that you have **two users** (whether it's acknowledged or not):

1. The user of the tool
2. The user of the output of the tool

No matter how many downloads Next.js gets, or how delightful and 
realtime the development experience, a universal truth remains: **[the customer is king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_customer_is_always_right)**.

Performance for the end-user has been baked in the design of everything
we make. To name some examples:

- Next.js was born out of the insight that React in its initial Single Page Application presentation was putting the rendering burden on the user's device that should have been on the [server](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html) instead. 
- [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) prioritized giving you a Real Experience Score calculated by each device, rather than just listing traffic stats or TTFB latencies.
- Pre-rendering at build time or via [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/incremental-static-regeneration-nextjs/) is all about [taking the CPU cycles entirely out](/2020/static-hoisting#hoist-to-the-edge) of the page serving equation, removing latency for the end user.

Our primary fitness function is your success for your customers. Not
every visitor might understand fully how every page is built, but if the
experience is delightful and fast, they ought to think it was powered by Vercel.

## 4. Relentless passion
