Following our [Series B last December](/2020/next-for-vercel), I'm happy to announce we've raised a [**$102M Series C**](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/vercel-raises-102m-series-c-for-its-next-js-based-front-end-development-platform) from existing and new investors.

Our vision of the Web is a global realtime medium for both creators and consumers,
where all friction and latency are eliminated.

We'll use this investment to:
1. [**Build the SDK for Web**](#next-momentum)
2. [**Lower the barrier of entry**](#realtime)
3. [**Focus on the end-user**](#real)

## 1. Build the SDK for the Web


Unlike other software development platforms, the Web never came with an SDK or Standard Development Kit.

While new browser APIs are constantly being added, 
the responsibility still falls on the developer to assemble them into an _engine_ for every new project.

The resulting diversity of tools and choices makes the Web the innovative and dynamic
medium that it is, but it can also be a major obstacle, as companies rally 
to reinvent themselves in the digital medium.
